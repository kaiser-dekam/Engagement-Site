                   Kaiser and Hannah met in January of 2012 when Kaiser took the seat behind Hannah in biology class.
Over the semester, they got to know each other, and in the spring, Hannah took Kaiser as her date to freshman formal (just as friends!). They spent that summer in their home states, Kaiser in Minnesota and Hannah in Indiana, and when they returned to Asbury that fall, they found themselves spending lots of time together in a large group of mutual friends. 
Then, in September of 2012, Kaiser asked Hannah on their first date. A few weeks later, they started dating officially. Some of their favorite memories over the past two years include date nights in Indianapolis, spending time at the De Kam&#39;s lake cabin in Minnesota, and seeing The Lumineers in concert (twice.). <br><br>
Then, on June 14, 2014, Kaiser came to visit Hannah in Indy for her birthday. They spent the day at some of Hannah&#39;s favorite places, including the Children&#39;s Museum and the Indianapolis Museum of Art. After spending some time walking around the gardens at the IMA, Kaiser sat Hannah down on a bench to give her a birthday present she would never forget. He handed her a black notebook that he had been secretly keeping since they started dating. The notebook contained journal entries, photos, and ticket stubs of concerts and movies they had seen together. Then, on the last page of the notebook was one simple question:<br><br>
&#39;Kaiser and Hannah De Kam?&#39;<br><br>
Kaiser got down on one knee, pulled out the ring, and the rest is history. They are excited to tie the knot on October 24, 2015, and they are even more excited about spending the rest of their lives together and seeing what God has in store for them.
